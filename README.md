# Student-Performance-Factors-Analysis

This project aims to predict student performance using machine learning techniques, enabling educators to better understand factors that influence academic success and to identify students in need of additional support. By leveraging data from various features like study time, previous grades, and socio-economic factors, we aim to create a predictive model that can assist in making data-driven educational decisions.
The methodology included implementing and training supervised and unsupervised learning models such as Random Forest, Linear Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and a Neural Network. Among these, Linear Regression and Random Forest emerged as top performers, achieving Root Mean Square Errors (RMSE) of approximately 1.12 and 1.16, respectively. The Neural Network also demonstrated strong results with a loss of 0.08 and an RMSE of 0.41. However, when PCA was applied prior to model training, the performance metrics declined, with models achieving an RÂ² score of 0.84.
These results highlight the effectiveness of advanced machine learning models, especially linear regression and random forest, in accurately predicting student outcomes from the characteristics analyzed.
